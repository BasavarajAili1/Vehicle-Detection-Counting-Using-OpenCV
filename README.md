Vehicle detecting and also counting are becomes growing important in a area of highway regulators. 
However,because of the various structure of vehicles, their detections remain challenging which directly influence in accuracy of a vehicle count.
The proposed technique uses the background subtraction method to discover forefront objects in video sequel. 
Several OpenCV techniques, including of a thresholding, the adaptive morphology operations, and hole filling are later applied in the series of detecting moving vehicles more accurately. 
At last, vehicle counting is done by utilizing virtual identification zones. The outcome of an Experiment shows the accuracy of the proposed counting systems is around 96%.

The main aim of our system is to detect the moments of vehicles by analyzing camera pictures with the help of computer vision. 
Vehicle counting process accepts the video from single camera & detects the moving vehicles and counts them. 
Vehicle detection and counting system on highway is developed using OpenCV image development kits.
