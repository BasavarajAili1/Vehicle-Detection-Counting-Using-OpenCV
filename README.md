## BUILD A VEHICLE DETECTION SYSTEM USING OPENCV AND PYTHON üöÄ
<p>
Vehicle detecting and also counting are becomes growing important in a area of highway regulators. 
However,because of the various structure of vehicles, their detections remain challenging which directly influence in accuracy of a vehicle count.
The proposed technique uses the background subtraction method to discover forefront objects in video sequel. 
Several OpenCV techniques, including of a thresholding, the adaptive morphology operations, and hole filling are later applied in the series of detecting moving vehicles more accurately. 
At last, vehicle counting is done by utilizing virtual identification zones. The outcome of an Experiment shows the accuracy of the proposed counting systems is around 96%.

The main aim of our system is to detect the moments of vehicles by analyzing camera pictures with the help of computer vision. 
Vehicle counting process accepts the video from single camera & detects the moving vehicles and counts them. 
Vehicle detection and counting system on highway is developed using OpenCV image development kits.

## Computer VisionüëÄ
<p>
Computer vision is a process by which we can understand the images and videos how 
they are stored and how we can manipulate and retrieve data from them. Computer Vision is 
the base or mostly used for Artificial Intelligence. Computer-Vision is playing a major role in 
self-driving cars, robotics as well as in photo correction apps.

## OpenCVüëç
<p>
OpenCV is the huge open-source library for the computer vision, machine learning, and 
image processing and now it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important 
in today‚Äôs systems. By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, 
or even handwriting of a human. When it integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy,
python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. To Identify image
pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on
these features.
The first OpenCV version was 1.0. OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence 
it‚Äôs free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces 
and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. When OpenCV was designed the 
main focus was real-time applications for computational efficiency. All things are written in 
optimized C/C++ to take advantage of multi-core processing.
It is the basic introduction to OpenCV we can continue the Applications and all the things in
our upcoming articles.

## Applications of OpenCV: 
There are lots of applications which are solved using OpenCV, some of them are listed below 
- face recognition
- Automated inspection and surveillance
- number of people ‚Äì count (foot traffic in a mall, etc)
- Vehicle counting on highways along with their speeds
- Interactive art installations
- Anomaly (defect) detection in the manufacturing process (the odd defective products)
- Street view image stitching
- Video/image search and retrieval
- Robot and driver-less car navigation and control
- object recognition

## Libraries used
- OpenCV (cv2)
- numpy
